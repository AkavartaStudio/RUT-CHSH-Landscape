\subsection{Synthesis: topology as a CHSH observable}
\label{sec:topology_synthesis}

% PLACEHOLDER

The results above establish that network topology shapes CHSH memory in
specific, predictable ways. Here we synthesize these findings into a unified
picture of how coupling graphs determine correlation structure.
