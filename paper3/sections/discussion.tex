The extension from two-oscillator to three-oscillator systems reveals that CHSH
memory is fundamentally shaped by network topology. Each motif---chain, star,
and triangle---exhibits distinct correlation patterns while sharing the
universal memory threshold $\sigma_{\mathrm{mem}}\approx 0.002$ established in
Paper~2.
