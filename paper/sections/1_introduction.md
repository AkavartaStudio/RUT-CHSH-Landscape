## 1. Motivation

The CHSH functional,

```
S = E(a,b) − E(a,b′) + E(a′,b) + E(a′,b′),
```

plays a central role in foundations of quantum mechanics. Bell's theorem establishes that **local** hidden-variable theories must satisfy |S| ≤ 2, while quantum mechanics—through entangled states and dichotomic measurements—can reach the Tsirelson bound of 2√2 ≈ 2.828.

The bound |S| ≤ 2 specifically constrains systems where:
- Measurement outcomes are predetermined (hidden variables)
- Subsystems are spatially separated (locality)
- Measurement choices are independent (no signaling)

Classical systems with **explicit coupling** between subsystems do not satisfy the locality assumption, and thus are not constrained by the |S| ≤ 2 bound. Nevertheless, the CHSH functional remains a well-defined mathematical object for any system producing correlation functions E(a,b), and its value provides information about correlation structure independent of quantum-classical distinctions.

**In this work**, we compute CHSH correlations directly from continuous phase differences Δθ(t) between coupled oscillators using E(a,b) = ⟨cos(Δθ + φ)⟩, without dichotomic thresholding or sign projection. This treats CHSH as a quantitative correlation functional probing joint phase-space geometry rather than a test of local hidden variables. The continuous-variable formulation has precedent in quantum optical phase-space measurements [Banaszek & Wódkiewicz 1999], and we apply it here to deterministic coupled oscillator dynamics.

Nonlinear phase-coupled oscillators—such as variants of the Kuramoto model—exhibit robust synchronization, persistent phase relations, and rich temporal structure. Yet the behavior of the CHSH functional in such systems, and the parameter regimes where |S| exceeds 2, have not been systematically characterized.

This work performs a controlled, high-resolution study of CHSH correlations generated by a pair of coupled nonlinear oscillators evolving under noise, detuning, and tunable measurement geometry. The goal is to **map the CHSH landscape** of a classical coupled system: to identify where |S| > 2 arises, how it depends on system parameters, and what dynamical features enable or suppress high-correlation regimes. This provides a systematic characterization of correlation geometry in a minimal nonlinear dynamical system.

## 2. Background and Context

Two-oscillator Kuramoto-type models provide a minimal setting where:

- **phase coherence** (synchronization strength) → affects correlation stability
- **frequency mismatch** (detuning) → controls phase-locking rigidity
- **coupling strength** → determines synchronization basin
- **external noise** → degrades correlation quality
- **measurement angle geometry** → sets projection axes in phase space

jointly determine the instantaneous correlation structure of the phase difference Δθ(t). Each parameter shapes the CHSH functional S through its effect on the joint phase distribution, making parameter-space mapping essential for understanding where high-|S| regimes emerge.

The global landscape of CHSH correlations in such systems — their dependence on noise, detuning, coupling, and angle choices — has not been systematically mapped, and the robustness of high-|S| regimes has not been quantified.

This paper provides, to our knowledge, the first systematic exploration of this landscape using large ensembles of trajectories and controlled parameter sweeps.

## 2.1 Related Work

Bell's theorem and the CHSH inequality were originally formulated in the context of quantum spin and polarization measurements, where dichotomic outcomes and photon counting are natural. Over the last two decades, however, several authors have emphasized that Bell-type correlations can appear in systems that are "classical" in other senses. Spreeuw and others introduced the idea of *classical entanglement* in multimode optical fields, showing that nonseparable correlations between polarization and spatial modes of a single beam can mimic quantum entanglement when described in a Hilbert-space framework [1]. Subsequent work on classical coherence and "entangled" classical light has demonstrated violations of Bell-like inequalities using carefully prepared optical fields and coherence functions, without invoking single-photon states [2,3].

A complementary line of work asks which mathematical ingredients of quantum theory are responsible for Bell violations. De Zela and others have constructed local realist models based on classical optics and inner-product probability measures that reproduce quantum-like correlations, arguing that Hilbert-space geometry, rather than nonlocality per se, underlies Bell's theorem [4]. There are also semiclassical models in which classical fields combined with quantum detection theory can violate Bell inequalities [5]. In a different direction, Gerhardt *et al.* showed that apparent violations can be *faked* with purely classical light by exploiting detector-control loopholes, underscoring the importance of strict experimental assumptions [6].

**How this work differs.** While the classical entanglement literature focuses primarily on optical field geometries, static coherence structures, or abstract Hilbert-space formulations, we study **time-evolving dynamical correlations** in a minimal two-oscillator deterministic system. Our approach trades field-theoretic complexity for dynamical richness, asking how phase-locking dynamics under noise and detuning sculpt the CHSH correlation landscape.

The present work differs from these approaches in three ways. First, we study a **deterministic dynamical system**—a pair of locally coupled phase oscillators with tunable coupling strength, frequency mismatch, and additive noise—rather than static optical fields or abstract probabilistic models. Second, we compute the standard **CHSH functional** directly from the continuous phase trajectories, without photon counting, threshold detection, or post-selection. Third, we map an explicit **phase diagram** in the space of coupling and noise, identifying a linear collapse boundary (σ_c(K)), an optimal measurement geometry, and a frequency-mismatch "sweet spot" where violations nearly saturate the Tsirelson bound. To our knowledge, no previous work has reported Bell–CHSH violations emerging from such a noisy deterministic phase-locking mechanism, nor documented the persistence of temporal memory after the CHSH value has returned to the |S| < 2 regime.

## 3. Objectives of This Paper

The present work aims to answer four foundational questions:

### (1) Under what conditions do nonlinear phase-coupled oscillators produce CHSH values |S| > 2?

We analyze how violations depend on:
- coupling strength K,
- frequency mismatch Δω,
- measurement geometry (angle differences),
- and additive noise σ.

### (2) How robust are these high-|S| correlations to noise?

We measure the critical noise strength σ_c at which |S| drops below 2 for given values of K. A dense sweep of coupling strengths reveals a clean linear scaling law with strong coupling-dependence and a non-zero noise intercept whose origin remains under investigation.

### (3) Which measurement geometries maximize CHSH values?

A full angle sweep identifies a broad ridge of high-|S| configurations with a well-defined optimum geometry producing correlations that nearly saturate the Tsirelson bound.

### (4) How do detuning and synchronization quality interact with CHSH structure?

We discover that moderate frequency mismatch slightly enhances |S| compared to rigid phase-locking, while large mismatch weakens synchronization and reduces |S|. This leads to a well-defined "optimal detuning" region where high correlations peak.

## 4. Scope of This Paper

This paper is intentionally narrow in scope. We do not address loophole-free Bell tests, quantum interpretations, or claims about quantum foundations. Our system **explicitly violates the locality assumption** of Bell's theorem through the coupling term K, making it a non-Bell system by construction. No detection loophole, no fair-sampling assumption, no hidden communication channel is invoked—the system simply does not satisfy the preconditions of Bell's theorem. Thus |S| > 2 does not contradict any established physics and requires no loophole-based explanation. Our aims are strictly:

- to map the CHSH landscape generated by a classical continuous dynamical system,
- to identify the structural ingredients required for violations,
- to quantify robustness using large controlled sweeps, and
- to establish a reproducible experimental suite for future exploration.

All simulations reported here use continuous measurement outcomes (not dichotomic signs), and all results are reproducible via scripts included with this paper.

This work provides:

1. the first detailed σ_c(K) scaling law for CHSH collapse in a continuous oscillator model;
2. the first high-resolution angle-space map showing the ridge and optimal geometry;
3. the first systematic Δω sweep identifying an "optimal tension" regime maximizing |S|;
