# Link to RET-A2 OSF Project

This manuscript builds upon and supersedes the exploratory work published as:

**RET-A2: Emergent Recursive Coupling**
Open Science Framework (OSF), July 2025

## Historical Context

The RET-A2 note documented early experiments (E101-E103) that showed unexpected CHSH violations in coupled oscillator systems. At the time, the mechanism was unclear and the initial hypothesis (that "imperfect lock creates violations") was incorrect.

## This Repository

The **RUT CHSH Landscape** work completes the story:

- **Corrects** the initial hypothesis (violations exist at perfect lock; noise only tests robustness)
- **Extends** the parameter space through systematic E107N sweep (220 experiments)
- **Identifies** three distinct regimes (Tsirelson Ridge, RUT Plateau, Forgetfulness Boundary)
- **Achieves** quantum-level violations (|S|=2.794, 98.8% of Tsirelson bound)
- **Maps** the complete PLI × |S| × σ landscape

## Relationship

RET-A2 remains available for:
- Transparency about the discovery process
- Historical record of hypothesis evolution
- Context for the time-varying coupling results (E103C)

This repository contains the **definitive, publication-ready** characterization of RUT CHSH violations.
