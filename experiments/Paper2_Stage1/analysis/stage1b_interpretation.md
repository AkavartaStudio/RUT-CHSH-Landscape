# Mission 1b Interpretation — Memory Collapse Cliff

## Context

- **Mission 1b** found the cliff (σ_mem ≈ 0.002)
- **Mission 2** maps the landscape leading up to the cliff

## Key Finding

The collapse of long-lag CHSH memory occurs at σ_mem ≈ 0.002 uniformly across all coupling strengths tested. The drop is discontinuous at our resolution: ρ_S(50) plunges from ≈0.95 at σ=0 to ≈0.003 at σ=0.002. This indicates a catastrophic transition rather than gradual decoherence, consistent with the onset of chaotic phase diffusion dominating the CHSH angle geometry. Notably, the collapse is K-independent, suggesting that echo coherence is controlled by a universal fragility mode not visible in |S| itself.

## Data Summary (E211b)

| K | ρ_det(τ=50) | ρ(σ=0.002) | σ_mem |
|---|-------------|------------|-------|
| 0.3 | 0.9542 | 0.0037 | 0.002 |
| 0.6 | 0.9542 | 0.0014 | 0.002 |
| 0.9 | 0.9542 | -0.0024 | 0.002 |

## Physical Interpretation

1. **Catastrophic transition**: Not gradual decoherence but a step-function collapse
2. **K-independence**: Memory fragility is universal across the CHSH ridge
3. **Universal fragility mode**: Echo coherence controlled by mechanism invisible in instantaneous |S|
4. **Chaotic phase diffusion**: Even infinitesimal noise (0.2% of ω₁) destroys temporal correlations
