# Science Notes for Mission 3

This Mission merges two distinct scientific domains:

## 3A. Loop-Charge (Φ) Dynamics
- static Φ
- circulating Φ
- reversal
- intermittency
- Φ(K), Φ(Δω), Φ-basins

## 3B. Braiding Dynamics
- permutation sequences
- braid index
- braid transitions
- braid-frequency maps
- chaos-edge crossings

They share code dependencies, so the Mission folder is unified, but the paper treats them as separate results sections.
